# CSE1142_HW3
This project was about creating our own String data type using C structs.There file i/o operations also.

In this homework, you will implement your own String data type using C structs. Each String is represented by a sequence of characters and should have a length property that shows the number of characters stored in that string (excluding the null character). Suppose that this struct can be used to represent only the strings with less than 50 characters. You should implement the following functions to operate on your String data type.
